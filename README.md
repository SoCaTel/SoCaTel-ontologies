# **SOCATEL conceptual framework**

This section includes details about the Semantic Preprocessing component, which aims to transform the external data collected by the data handlers into RDF and store it into SoCaTel's knowledge base. In particular, the section includes the following pages concerning different aspects of the transformation process:

-   [SoCaTel Core Ontology](SoCaTelCoreOntology.md): includes the design of the SoCaTel ontology used to represent data retrieved from the external sources in the knowledge base.
-   [External Ontologies](ExternalOntologies.md): includes a list of existing ontologies related to the domains of the external sources from which the data is retrieved. These ontologies will be used in the future to represent more specific information about the external data sources.
-   [Ontology Mappings](OntologyMappings.md): includes detailed information about the mappings between each type of external source on one hand, and both the SoCaTel Core Ontology and considered external ontologies on the other.
-   [Transformation Tools](TransformationTools.md): includes a comparison between different tools that can be used to transform the data retrieved from the external sources to RDF format, following the ontologies and mappings defined in previous pages.
-   [RDF Data](RDFData.md): includes the dump files of the result of applying the Semantic Preprocessing pipeline to the sample data.
